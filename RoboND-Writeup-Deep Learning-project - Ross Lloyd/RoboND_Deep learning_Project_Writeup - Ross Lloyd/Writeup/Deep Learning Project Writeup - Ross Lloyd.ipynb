    "The aim of this project was to train and use a Fully Convolutional Neural network, to allow a virtual drone to identify and follow a chosen character - the 'hero' - within a simulator. This hero would be among many other \"distractor\" characters, making for a good test of the ability of the network to correctly identify the object of interest.\n",

    "The simulator was run in the Unity Engine, with helper code to drive the virtual drone provided by Udacity. The network model provided by the student then assessed the data coming from the simulator. As such the main focus of the project was to create a network using Keras and to attain at least a 40% global accuracy figure on tests of Intersection over Union metrics.\n",

    "Broadly speaking, a Fully Convolutional Network is a powerful type of Neural Network, capable of carrying out complex computer vision tasks such as identifying objects in an image. However, unlike a simple classifier, it is capable of showing *where* in the image the object of interest is located. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a significant improvement over simpler convolutional neural nets that have, as their output, a **'fully connected layer'**. It is called fully connected because every 'neuron' in the layer is connected to every output in the preceding layer, and then uses for example a softmax activation to determine if examples of particular classes of objects that we are looking for are present within the image. As such it removes data that tells us about space, and can only answer the question \"is the object present **anywhere** in the image\", as opposed to \"is the object present, and **where can I find it** \". \n",
    "\n",
    "Fully Convolutional Neural networks are able to both identify the object and identify where it is and should be used as such. It does this by replacing the fully connected layer with a 'Decoder', as illustrated below, itself built from convolutional neural nets. The input to the decoder, in keeping with this convention, then becomes the \"Encoder\". The decoder takes the information processed by the encoder and \"blows it up\" to the size of the original image. This then allows us to perform semantic segmentation on a pixel by pixel basis, for example identifying the pixels that belong to cars, traffic lights etc in the image below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of FCN's is that they can use images of any size, whereas a convnet with fully connected layer cannot, due to the mechanics of matrix multiplication involved in each.\n",
    "\n",
    "A disadvantage of the FCN Encoder / Decoder model is that the extensive use of convolutions leads to longer model training times. Use of very deep models may use up large amounts of memory, and if skip connections are used to ensure no loss of coarser grained data, its possible for model size to become prohibitively large.\n",

    "The drone finds the hero at the second opportunity, which is when their paths meet. Due primarily to the poor performance at distance, the drone does not spot the hero when she is first visible, just beyond the tree at around the 0:36 mark (not visible in video). Once the drone has found the target, it robustly tracks it during interactions with other crowd members and when the hero turns corners."

    "This is an interesting question. In order to have any neural network function well, we need to train it on good quality data that is representative of the task it will be required to do. In this case, you would need to create new images and masks that include dogs, cats, cars etc in order to identify those objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some research papers (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.08986.pdf) have suggested that the performance of Fully Convolutional Neural Netorks drops off on smaller sized objects due to the inbuilt downsampling of information. Using higher resolution imagery can help, as can the above mentioned paper's use of IFCN, which contains a \"context network, which is a densely branched convolution network\". So if using the model to find small objects like cats, some of these modifications may be required."

    "We could use a max pooling layer before the batch normalization, which is useful to prevent overfitting and further downsample the image, as well as providing a degree of translation invariance. I chose not to, in order to see how far I could get with the more \"stock\" classroom example. We are also already accomplishing quite marked downsampling with our separable convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might also have used some regularization such as L1 / L2 or dropout, however these can lead to higher computational overheads and in any case, batch normalization has some regularization effects. It may still have been useful to apply further regularization in the event of overfitting. As noted, batch sizes had an impact on the vildation loss diverging, so an alternative might have been to try using a simpler model with less capacity and adding regularization or dropout.\n",
